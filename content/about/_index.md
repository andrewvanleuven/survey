The information gathered from this survey will help state and local Main Street programs identify factors associated with job satisfaction, program success, and the spread of innovative ideas. The results will provide insights into differences between states and between programs of different sizes, structure, and purposes-- allowing you to benchmark your Main Street Program to other programs with similar characteristics.

The survey should take between 20 and 30 minutes to complete. The results will eventually be sent to all members of the Main Street Program network. **Those who complete the survey will be sent an early release report detailing the findings of the survey!**
