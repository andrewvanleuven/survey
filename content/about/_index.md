Researchers at The Ohio State University are studying the Main Street Program and the people who implement it in their communities. We are interested in learning more about Main Street Program operations and how Main Street Programs measure their success.

The information gathered from this survey will help state and local Main Street programs identify factors associated with job satisfaction, program success, and the spread of innovative ideas. The results will provide insights into differences between states and between programs of different sizes, structure, and purposes-- allowing you to benchmark your Main Street Program to other programs with similar characteristics.
